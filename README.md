# rain_prediction_with_machine_learning
## Hi
It's a machine learning project for estimating rain, using KNN, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.
In this repository, there is a machine learning project for my IBM machine learning course. in this lab, i use four different machine learning algorithm such as Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.
I use a rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology.
For validation, i use 7 metrics such as Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error and R2-Score.
